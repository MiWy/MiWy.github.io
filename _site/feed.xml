        <description>&lt;b&gt;calmNow&lt;/b&gt; app is under development at the moment. The goal of this app is to provide user with positive feedback at anytime necessary. Here are some examples. If you're having a panic attack, open the app and follow instruction to calm yourself. If you're just woke up and don't feel like getting up, open the app and identify yourself with the positive content that's inside. I think that this app will be different than usual how-to-meditate-and-think-positively kind of apps. As always, the app itself will be free.</description>
